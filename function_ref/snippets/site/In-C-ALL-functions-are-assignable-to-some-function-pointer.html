<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>In C ALL functions are assignable to some function pointer. In C++ ALL free functions are assignable to some function pointer and ALL member functions are assignable to some member function pointer. These two statements are no where near synonymous and consequently the usefulness of function pointers as a whole have been crippled. This has limited the effectiveness of performing functional programming in C++ because it effects being able to pass usable function pointers [types] as parameters to functions and being able to return them. Any given function pointer type is less useful because they are limited to which functions they can point to. The current bifurcation segregates the functional programming world from the object oriented programming world where in one paradigm you'll favor function pointer over member function pointer or vice versa. This can be likened to swiss cheese.</p>

<p>The actual cheese represents were a C function pointer can go. Each hole represents a single class, a pocket universe, where only the C++ member function pointer for just that class can go. Where is the function pointer that can go <b>ANYWHERE</b>, like in C?</p>
<p>Ironically, this was not the case or at least less of an issue in the beginning of C++. Someone correct me if I am wrong. My knowledge of ancient C++ history is second hand. In the beginning of C++, C++ was a preprocessor, C with classes called CFront. The C++ cc files were converted from C++ into C. That would mean constructors, destructors, operators and member functions were converted to C functions which could be assigned to a C function pointer. This translation was never standardized either due to lack of interest or the desire to give compiler writers optimization opportunities. In either case, an important functionality went missing. So, Bjarne Stroustrup had it right all along.</p>
<p>Member function pointer was never the solution. In most compilers, the member function pointer is a <a href="#reference-obscure">fat pointer</a> that has additional data to perform tasks/transformations related to virtual inheritance and multiple inheritance. Even in the case of the Digital Mars compiler their is a <a href="#reference-obscure">thunk function</a> that perform these translations. The cost of virtual inheritance is unnecessary when the function is not being called virtually because you know exactly which function you want to call. That is not to say that the member function isn't virtual. Rather there is desire to call that specific function at runtime via function pointer non virtually. Further the repeated cost of multiple inheritance is not needed everytime a function is called when the instance type has already been cast to the correct type and the function is being called multiple times. Also the member function pointer is usually dependent upon a reference to an object in order to determine which function is being called because the instance has the pointer to the vtable when virtual polymorphism is involved.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>Member function pointer initializer, NOT member function pointer, SHOULD be assignable to a free function.<p>

<p>Here, I demonstrated the desired usage via the explicit static_cast. This proposal is focused on the explicit cast in order to restore this missing functionality. Explicit is required regardless in order to allow the end user to resolve overloads, as demonstrated. It is my believe that explicit cast would not be a breaking change. However if compilers can implement this proposal as a C cast and/or implicit cast than that could also make things easier for direct users versus library writers who would use this in their private implementations. The important thing is to restore the missing functionality.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why bother? What do we gain?</h2>
<ol>
<li>sanding of some rough edges of C++ by making it more uniform and consistent</li>
<li>completing some unfinished work that is as old as C++ itself</li>
<li>undoing a bifurcation when member function pointers were standardized</li>
<li>restoring the power of free function pointers back to the C and proto C++ era</li>
<li>unified function pointers; free functions can reference free and member functions; argument dependent lookup is less of an issue when you are explicitly telling which function is to be selected</li>
<li>There is no need for the end user to create a binder to convert a member function into a free function effectively tying the object oriented and functional paradigms back together.</li>
<li>No need to resort to templates to provide something the core language is already providing in other places in C++ thus making things even easier.</li>
</ol>
<p>Concerning the last two, the "// binding via templates" portion of the example illustrates what library writers and end users have to do today to work around this limitation. Even if the explicit template example can be reduced with an implicit auto... solution, it would still be a verbose unintuitive resolution that depends on templates unnecessarily.</p>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="ecx">What about ECX?</h3>
<p>In Microsoft C++ compilers, the this pointer is stored in the ECX register when calling a member function instead of being passed on the stack. Worse case a C++ compiler would need to provide both implementations or one calling the other. One implementation could be elided based on end user usage patterns. In reality this is little different than an inline function. A function could be kept around if the function was ever assigned to a function pointer and in other cases the stack frame could be elided altogether. Further, any compiler can choose to store any parameter in a register. Compiler optimizations should not limit the reasonable functionality provided by the language.</p>
<h3 id="deducing-this">How does this relate to <a href="#reference-deducing-this">Deducing this</a>?</h3>
<p>In Deducing this, deducing this member functions are implicit cast to function pointers already and do not cast implicitly or explicitly to member function pointers. So in reality there is no change. This proposal would actually be complimentary in that regard and even more so if this proposed explicit cast could be made implicit without any breaking changes. The only difference is the type of this pointer in the free function. In this proposal it would be a variation of a reference always. In deducing this, there is the option of it be a value, especially for small types.</p>
<h3 id="void">How might this combine with composite void*/guaranteed inlining?</h3>
<p>A future proposal, composite void*, would explore enhancing void* conversions in more advanced aggregated types. One variation of this would allow function pointers with pointers and/or lvalue references to be cast to other function pointers with those pointers and references being swapped out with a void pointer and still be callable without any undefined behavior. This proposal would be complementary with such a future proposal allowing simple type erased pointers to member functions.</p>
