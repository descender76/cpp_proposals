<p>Following current void* semantics, allow the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>free function pointers can be implicitly cast to other free function pointer types where one or more of its parameters or return value types that are pointers or lvalue references has been replaced with void*</li>
<li>free function pointers can be explicitly cast to other free function pointer types where one or more of its parameters or return value types that are void pointers has been replaced with any other pointer or lvalue reference type</li>
<li>it is not undefined behavior that the type erased free function pointers can be called provided the caller ensures the correct parameter types are passed</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="why">Why bother? What do we gain?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Core language support for type erased free functions</li>
<li>Removing some of the need to manually create binders for compatible free function pointer types; guaranteed inlining</li>
<li>Ease of use for not having to resort to templactes unnecessarily</li>
<li>Replace some undefined behavior in C++ with defined behavior</li>
<li>A logical and natural extension to the purpose of void*</li>
</ol>

<p>While this proposal is exclusively focused on free function pointer and their types, this paper is called "void* composition" because the expansion of void* use cases is considered in general. C++ inherited void* from C because some [runtime] problems are better solved by dropping compiler checks. C++ is a [mostly] strongly typed language. Our community as a whole values compile time and stongly typed solutions to our daily problems. So it is not a stretch to realize that most proposals since C++'s inception is focused on type safe solutions instead of reducing type safety such as improving how void* can be used. Consequently, when new features are added to the language perhaps, little consideration is given to how void* could be benefited by it.</p>
<p>Consider for a moment lvalue reference. It is basically a slightly smarter pointer; no nullptrs(s) and a single level of indirection that is easier to use because it behaves like a value by default. Since it is a pointer, couldn't it also be type erased; implicitly converted to void*, explicity to NON void* with the same binary representation. While by themselves the value is minor however if allowed to aggregate they can be invaluable.</p>
<p>What about pointer to aggregate types that contains typed pointers! Could these pointers be cast to other pointers of <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/type#Compatible_types" target="__blank">compatible types</a> with the only change that some of the type pointers has been replaced with untyped void pointers. Ironically C NOT C++ already have a similar feature that does NOT work with void* type erasure called <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/type#Compatible_types" target="__blank">compatible types</a>. This proposal is not advocating for or against adding compatible types as a whole and latter enhancing it to support void*. That sounds like a bigger endeavor. What is more, it is probably less intuitive to do so because at the end of the day you are casting the pointers between two unrelated types. Note that phrase "two unrelated types". What about two related types where both types are template instantiations of a common template where in one case a template is passed a non void type parameter and in another case a void type parameter. Perhaps since the two types are related their could be a minimal compatible type feature which in reality would do noting more than consistently guarantee size, alignment and layout of an aggregated type.</p>
<p>If void* use cases could be enhanced to support aggregated types, what about a free function pointer type that logically accepts and returns aggregates of types. This latter use case is what this proposal is laser focused on. At the end of the day, this proposal is all about consistency of size, alignment and layout. Ironically, our current compilers are remarkably consistent. As such this feature is supported today in some compilers as undefined behavior which is clearly definable. As such we just need to standardize the consistency that compilers are already doing. In the following working example, all of these use cases are explored.</p>
