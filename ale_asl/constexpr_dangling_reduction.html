<h2 id="abstract"><a class="anchor" href="#abstract"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Abstract</h2>
<p>Lifetime issues with references to temporaries can lead to fatal and subtle runtime errors. This applies to
both:</p>
<ul>
<li>Returned references (for example, when using strings or maps) and</li>
<li>Returned objects that do not have value semantics (for example using std::string_view).</li>
</ul>
<p>This paper proposes the standard adopt existing common practices in order to eliminate dangling in some cases and in many other cases, greatly reduce them.</p>
<h2 id="motivating-examples"><a class="anchor" href="#motivating-examples"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motivating Examples</h2>
<p>Let’s motivate the feature for both classes not having value semantics and references.</p>
<h3 id="classes-not-having-value-semantics"><a class="anchor" href="#classes-not-having-value-semantics"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Classes not Having Value Semantics</h3>
<p>C++ allows the definition of classes that do not have value semantics. One famous example is <code>std::string_view</code>: The lifetime of a <code>string_view</code> object is bound to an underlying string or character sequence.</p>
<p>Because string has an implicit conversion to <code>string_view</code>, it is easy to accidentally program a <code>string_view</code> to a character sequence that doesn’t exist anymore.</p>
<p>A trivial example is this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in">std</span>::string_view sv = <span class="hljs-string">"hello world"</span>s;<span class="hljs-comment">// immediate dangling reference</span></code></pre><p>It is clear from this <code>string_view</code> example that it dangles because <code>sv</code> is a reference and <code>"hello world"s</code> is a temporary.
<strong><em>What is being proposed is that same example doesn't dangle!</em></strong>
If the evaluated constant expression <code>"hello world"s</code> had static storage duration just like the string literal <code>"hello world"</code> has static storage duration <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> <sup><em>(5.13.5 String literals [lex.string])</em></sup> then <code>sv</code> would be a reference to something that is global and as such would not dangle. This is reasonable based on how programmers reason about constants being immutable variables and temporaries which are known at compile time and do not change for the life of the program. There are a few facts to take note of in the previous example.</p>
<ul>
<li>constants, whether <code>"hello world"</code> or <code>"hello world"s</code>, <strong>are not expected by programmers</strong> to dangle but rather to be immutable and available for the life of the program in other words <code>const</code> and <code>static storage duration</code></li>
<li>sv is <code>constant-initialized</code> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1:1">[1:1]</a></sup> <sup><em>(7.7 Constant expressions [expr.const])</em></sup></li>
<li>the <code>constexpr</code> constructor of <code>std::string_view</code> <strong>expects</strong> a <code>const</code> argument</li>
</ul>
<!--
This is reasonable based on how users reason about constants, safer because of less dangling and simpler because something as simple as constants shouldn't dangle.
-->
<p>Dangling can occur more indirectly as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in">std</span>::<span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">operator</span>+ (<span class="hljs-built_in">std</span>::string_view s1, <span class="hljs-built_in">std</span>::string_view s2) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">std</span>::<span class="hljs-built_in">string</span>{s1} + <span class="hljs-built_in">std</span>::<span class="hljs-built_in">string</span>{s2};
}
<span class="hljs-built_in">std</span>::string_view sv = <span class="hljs-string">"hi"</span>;
sv = sv + sv; <span class="hljs-comment">// fatal runtime error: sv refers to deleted temporary string</span></code></pre><p><strong>The problem here is that the lifetime of the temporary is bound to the statement in which it was created, instead of the block that contains said expression.</strong></p>
<p><code>Working Draft, Standard for Programming Language C++</code> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1:2">[1:2]</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>"<em>6.7.7 Temporary objects</em>"</strong></p>
<p>"<em>Temporary objects are destroyed as the last step in evaluating the full-expression (6.9.1) that (lexically) contains the point where they were created. This is true even if that evaluation ends in throwing an exception. The value computations and side effects of destroying a temporary object are associated only with the full-expression, not with any specifc subexpression.</em>"</p>
<p>Had the temporary been bound to the enclosing block than it would have been alive for at least as long as the reference. While this does reduce dangling, it does not eliminate it because if the reference out lives its containing block such as by returning than dangling would still occur. These remaining dangling would at least be more visible as they are usually associated with returns, so you know where to look and if we make the proposed changes than there would be far fewer dangling to look for. It should also be noted that <strong>the current lifetime rules of temporaries are like constants, contrary to programmer's expectations</strong>. This becomes more apparent with more complicated examples.</p>
<!--
If you argue that the bugs in these examples are easy to see, consider a template calling operator+
instead for a passed string view:

```cpp
template<typename T>
T add(T x1, T x2) {
  return x1 + x2 ;
}
sv = add(sv, sv); // fatal runtime error
```

We already see code like this.

We can better support these types by giving the ability to annotate a function declaration to indicate that the lifetime of an object used as part of a parameter's value or the *this object must live at least as long as the return value does.

For example, the problem above can be detected or even just made to work if the constructor defining the implicit conversion is marked so that the lifetime of the created string_view depends on a passed string.

- If the implicit conversion is enabled by a constructor, this might look as follows (with lifetimebound
representing whatever we might introduce as new feature):

```cpp
template<class charT, class traits = char_traits<charT>>
class basic_string_view {
public:
...
  template<class Allocator>
  basic_string_view(const basic_string<charT, traits, Allocator>& str lifetimebound) noexcept;
...
};
```

- If (as it is the case currently) the conversion is defined by a conversion operator, this might look as follows:

```cpp
template<class charT, class traits = char_traits<charT>,
class Allocator = allocator<charT>>
class basic_string {
public:
...
  operator basic_string_view<charT, traits>() const lifetimebound noexcept;
...
};
```

Note that we could use the feature to

- Either extend the lifetime of prvalues as it is done for references to prvalues.
- Or enable compilers to warn about code like in the example above.

<h3 id="returned-references-to-temporaries"><a class="anchor" href="#returned-references-to-temporaries"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Returned References to Temporaries</h3>
<p>Similar problems already exists with references.</p>
<p>A trivial example would be the following:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">struct</span> X { <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> a, b; };
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span>&amp; <span class="hljs-title">f</span><span class="hljs-params">(X&amp; x)</span> </span>{ <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> x.a; } <span class="hljs-comment">// return value lifetime bound to parameter</span></code></pre><p>If <code>f</code> was called with a temporary than it too would dangle.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span>&amp; a = f({<span class="hljs-number">4</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>});
a = <span class="hljs-number">5</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// fatal runtime error</span></code></pre><p>If the lifetime of the temporary, <code>{4, 2}</code>, was bound to the lifetime of its containing block instead of its containing statement than <code>a</code> would not immediately dangle.</p>
<p>Class std::string provides such an interface in the current C++ runtime library. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">char</span>&amp; c = <span class="hljs-built_in">std</span>::<span class="hljs-built_in">string</span>{<span class="hljs-string">"hello my pretty long string"</span>}[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>];
c = <span class="hljs-string">'x'</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// fatal runtime error</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">std</span>::<span class="hljs-built_in">cout</span> &lt;&lt; <span class="hljs-string">"c: "</span> &lt;&lt; c &lt;&lt; <span class="hljs-string">'\n'</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// fatal runtime error</span></code></pre><p>Again, if the lifetime of the temporary, <code>std::string{"hello my pretty long string"}</code>, was bound to the lifetime of its containing block instead of its containing statement than <code>c</code> would not immediately dangle. Further, this more complicated compound temporary expression better illustrates why the current lifetime rules of temporaries are contrary to programmer's expectations. First of all, let's rewrite the example, as a programmer would, adding names to everything unnamed.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">auto</span> anonymous = <span class="hljs-built_in">std</span>::<span class="hljs-built_in">string</span>{<span class="hljs-string">"hello my pretty long string"</span>};
<span class="hljs-keyword">char</span>&amp; c = anonymous[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>];
c = <span class="hljs-string">'x'</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// fatal runtime error</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">std</span>::<span class="hljs-built_in">cout</span> &lt;&lt; <span class="hljs-string">"c: "</span> &lt;&lt; c &lt;&lt; <span class="hljs-string">'\n'</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// fatal runtime error</span></code></pre><p>Even though, the code is the same from a programmer's perspective, the latter does not dangle while the former do. <strong>Should just naming variables fix memory issues? Should just leaving variables unnamed introduce memory issues?</strong> Again, contrary to programmer's expectations.</p>
<!--
Again, we should be able mark the return value of the index operators/functions accordingly to get corresponding
warnings or the expected behavior:

```cpp
template<class charT, class traits = char_traits<charT>,
class Allocator = allocator<charT>>
class basic_string {
public:
...
  const_reference operator[](size_type pos) const lifetimebound;
  reference operator[](size_type pos) lifetimebound;
  const_reference at(size_type n) const lifetimebound;
  reference at(size_type n) lifetimebound;
...
};
```
-->
<p>There are more tricky cases like this. For example, when using the range-base for loop:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">auto</span> x : reversed(make_vector()))</code></pre><p>with one of the following definitions, either:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">template</span>&lt;Range R&gt;
<span class="hljs-function">reversed_range <span class="hljs-title">reversed</span><span class="hljs-params">(R&amp;&amp; r)</span> </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> reversed_range{r}; <span class="hljs-comment">// return value lifetime bound to parameter</span>
}</code></pre><p>or</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">template</span>&lt;Range R&gt;
<span class="hljs-function">reversed_range <span class="hljs-title">reversed</span><span class="hljs-params">(R r)</span> </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> reversed_range{r}; <span class="hljs-comment">// return value lifetime bound to parameter</span>
}</code></pre><p>Yet again, if the lifetime of the temporary, <code>reversed(make_vector())</code>, was bound to the lifetime of its containing block instead of its containing statement than <code>x</code> would not immediately dangle. Before adding names to everything unnamed, we must expand the range based for loop.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">{<span class="hljs-comment">// containing block</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">auto</span>&amp;&amp; rg = reversed(make_vector());
  <span class="hljs-keyword">auto</span> pos = rg.begin();
  <span class="hljs-keyword">auto</span> end = rg.end();
  <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> ( ; pos != end; ++pos ) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">auto</span> x = *pos;
    ...
  }
}</code></pre><p>Now, let's rewrite that expansion, as a programmer would, adding names to everything unnamed.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">{<span class="hljs-comment">// containing block</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">auto</span> anonymous1 = make_vector();
  <span class="hljs-keyword">auto</span> anonymous2 = reversed(anonymous1);
  <span class="hljs-keyword">auto</span> pos = anonymous2.begin();
  <span class="hljs-keyword">auto</span> end = anonymous2.end();
  <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> ( ; pos != end; ++pos ) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">auto</span> x = *pos;
    ...
  }
}</code></pre><p>Like before, the named version doesn't dangle and as such binding the lifetime of the temporary to the containing block makes more sense to the programmer than binding the lifetime of the temporary to the containing statement. It should be noted too that besides increasing the lifespan of a temporary to a reasonable degree not only reduces dangling but also reduces the naming of variables which could be returned and dangled. This will encourage the use of temporaries instead of the present dangling that discourages the use of temporaries.</p>
<p>Finally, such a feature would also help to fix several bugs we see in practice:</p>
<p>Consider we have a function returning the value of a map element or a default value if no such element exists without copying it:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> V&amp; <span class="hljs-title">findOrDefault</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">std</span>::<span class="hljs-built_in">map</span>&lt;K,V&gt;&amp; m, <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> K&amp; key, <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> V&amp; defvalue)</span></span>;</code></pre><p>then this results in a classical bug:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in">std</span>::<span class="hljs-built_in">map</span>&lt;<span class="hljs-built_in">std</span>::<span class="hljs-built_in">string</span>, <span class="hljs-built_in">std</span>::<span class="hljs-built_in">string</span>&gt; myMap;
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">std</span>::<span class="hljs-built_in">string</span>&amp; s = findOrDefault(myMap, key, <span class="hljs-string">"none"</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// runtime bug if key not found</span></code></pre><p>Is this really a bug? With this proposal, it isn't! Here is why. The function <code>findOrDefault</code> <strong>expects</strong> a <strong><code>const</code></strong> <code>string&amp;</code> for its third parameter. Since <code>C++20</code>, string's constructor is <code>constexpr</code>. It <strong>CAN</strong> be constructed as a constant expression. Since all the arguments passed to this <code>constexpr</code> constructor are constant expressions, in this case <code>"none"</code>, the temporary <code>string</code> <code>defvalue</code> <strong>IS</strong> also <code>constant-initialized</code> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1:3">[1:3]</a></sup> <sup><em>(7.7 Constant expressions [expr.const])</em></sup>. This paper advises that if you have a non <code>mutable</code> <code>const</code> that it is <code>constant-initialized</code>, that the variable or temporary undergoes <code>constant initialization</code> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1:4">[1:4]</a></sup> <sup><em>(6.9.3.2 Static initialization [basic.start.static])</em></sup>. In other words it has implicit <code>static storage duration</code>. The temporary would actually cease to be a temporary. As such this usage of <code>findOrDefault</code> <strong>CAN'T</strong> dangle.</p>
<p>What if <code>defvalue</code> can't be <code>constant-initialized</code> because it was created at runtime. If the temporary string's lifetime was bound to the containing block instead of the containing statement than chance of dangling is greatly reduced and also made more visible. You can say that it <strong>CAN'T</strong> immediately dangle but still could if the programmer manually propagated the temporary outside of the containing scope.</p>
<p>While using the containing's scope instead of the statement's scope is a vast improvement. We can actually do a little bit better. Following is an example of delayed initialization.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">bool</span> <span class="hljs-title">test</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span>;

<span class="hljs-keyword">struct</span> X { <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> a, b; };

<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> X* <span class="hljs-title">ref2pointer</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> X&amp; ref)</span>

}

  }
  <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>
  {

    <span class="hljs-comment">// statement scope or</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// containing scope or</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// scope of the variable to which the temporary is assigned</span>
  }
}</code></pre><p>According to this proposal, <code>ref2pointer({2, 4})</code> would undergo implicit <code>static storage duration</code> so that expression would not dangle. The variable would dangle if initialized with the expression <code>ref2pointer(x_factory(4, 2))</code> when the scope is bound to the containing statement. The variable would also dangle if initialized with the expression <code>ref2pointer(x_factory(4, 2))</code> when the scope is bound to the containing block. The variable would NOT dangle if initialized with the expression <code>ref2pointer(x_factory(4, 2))</code> when the scope is bound to the lifetime of the variable to which the temporary is assigned, in this case <code>x</code>.</p>

TODO

```cpp
struct X { int a, b; };

-->
<p>The preceding sections of this proposal is identical at times in wording as well as in examples to <code>p0936r0</code>, the <code>Bind Returned/Initialized Objects to the Lifetime of Parameters</code> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> proposal. This shows that similar problems can be solved with simpler solutions that programmers are already familiar with, such as constants and naming temporaries. It must be conceded that <code>Bind Returned/Initialized Objects to the Lifetime of Parameters</code> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2:1">[2:1]</a></sup> is a more general solution while this proposal is more easily understood by programmers of all experience levels.</p>
<p><strong>Why not just extend the lifetime as prescribed in <code>Bind Returned/Initialized Objects to the Lifetime of Parameters</code>?</strong></p>
<p>In that proposal, a question was raised.</p>
<p><em>"Lifetime Extension or Just a Warning?"</em>
<em>"We could use the marker in two ways:"</em></p>
<ol>
<li><em>"Warn only about some possible buggy behavior."</em></li>
<li><em>"Fix possible buggy behavior by extending the lifetime of temporaries"</em></li>
</ol>
<p>In reality, there are three scenarios; warning, <strong>error</strong> or just fix it by extending the lifetime.</p>
<p>However, things in the real world tend to be more complicated. Depending upon the scenario, at least theoretically some could be fixed, some could be errors and some could be warnings. Further, waiting on a more complicated solution that can fix everything may never happen, so shouldn't we fix what we can, when we can; i.e. low hanging fruit. Also, fixing everything the same way may not even be desirable. Let's consider a real scenario. Extending one's lifetime could mean 2 different things.</p>
<ol>
<li>Change automatic storage duration such that a instances' lifetime is just moved higher up the stack as prescribed in p0936r0.</li>
<li>Change automatic storage duration to static storage duration. [This is what I am proposing but only for those that it logically applies to.]</li>
</ol>
<p>If only #1 was applied holistically via p0936r0, -Wlifetime or some such then that would not be appropriate/reasonable for those that really should be fixed by #2. Likewise #2 can't fix all but MAY make sense for those that it applies to. As such, this proposal and <code>p0936r0</code> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2:2">[2:2]</a></sup> are complimentary.</p>
<p>Personally, <code>p0936r0</code> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2:3">[2:3]</a></sup> should be adopted regardless because we give the compiler more information than it had before, that argument(s) lifetime is dependent upon the return(s) lifetime. When we give more information, like we do with const and constexpr, the <code>C++</code> compiler can do amazing things. Any reduction in undefined behavior, dangling references/pointers and delayed/unitialized errors should be welcomed, at least as long it can be explained simply and rationally.</p>

## Abstract

This document proposes enhancements to `constant initialization` [^n4910] <sup>6.9.3.2 Static initialization [basic.start.static]<sup> to decrease the shock of working with constants, literals and constant like expressions in C++ with the ultimate goal of reducing the frequency of encountering dangling references.

## Motivating Examples

<h2 id="in-depth-rationale"><a class="anchor" href="#in-depth-rationale"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>In Depth Rationale</h2>
<p>There is a general expectation across programming languages that constants or more specifically constant literals are "immutable values which are known at compile time and do not change for the life of the program".  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> In most programming languages or rather the most widely used programming languages, constants do not dangle. Constants are so simple, so trivial (English wise), that it is shocking to even have to be conscience of dangling. This is shocking to <code>C++</code> beginners, expert programmers from other programming languages who come over to <code>C++</code> and at times even shocking to experienced <code>C++</code> programmers.</p>
<!--

The shock is not limited to dangling, though that is the greater one, when it does happen. There are also seemingly inconsistencies with respect to `value categories` and `storage durations`.

### Value Categories

`Working Draft, Standard for Programming Language C++` [^n4910]

**"*7.5.1 Literals [expr.prim.literal]*"**

"*1 The type of a literal is determined based on its form as specifed in 5.13. A string-literal is an lvalue designating a corresponding string literal object (5.13.5), a user-defned-literal has the same value category as the corresponding operator call expression described in 5.13.8, and any other literal is a prvalue.*"

**Should a beginner `C++` programmer need to know `value categories` in order to create and use constants safely!** Besides the seeming inconsistency, I mention value categories because what is being proposed may require fine tuning the value catgories of literals. Accepting this proposal might mean that non string literals will be lvalue when they are constant expressions and prvalue when they are not constant expressions. If this proposal is ever combined with `Bind Returned/Initialized Objects to the Lifetime of Parameters` [^bindp] then string literals might also be lvalue when they are constant expressions and prvalue, with automatic storage duration, when they are not constant expressions. Combined, this could unify the behavior of literals, moving the seeming inconsistency from the type of the literal to the constness of the literal were it makes more sense and more valuable from a dangling stand point.

<p><code>Working Draft, Standard for Programming Language C++</code> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1:5">[1:5]</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>"<em>5.13.5 String literals [lex.string]</em>"</strong></p>
<p>"<em>9 <strong>Evaluating a string-literal results in a string literal object with static storage duration</strong> (6.7.5). Whether all string-literals are distinct (that is, are stored in nonoverlapping objects) and whether successive evaluations of a string-literal yield the same or a diﬀerent object is unspecifed.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>[Note 4: The effect of attempting to modify a string literal object is undefined. — end note]</em>"</p>
<p>String literals have static storage duration, and thus exist in memory for the life of the program. All the other types of literals have automatic storage duration by default. While that may makes perfect sense for literals that are not constant, constants on other hand are generally believed to be the same value for the life of the program and are ideal candidates to have static storage duration so they can exist in memory for the life of the program. Since literals currently don't behave this way, constant [like] literals are not as simple as they could be, leading to superfluous dangling.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the static storage duration doesn't come from the fact that it is a constant expression and that a constant was expected/requested.

While supporting implicit static storage duration here does not decrease dangling, it would be of benefit from a language simplicitly standpoint for this to be consistent with the next two sections; function body and their parameters and arguments. However since this section has to do with class data member definition and not code execution, explicit static could still be required, if their is a real and significent concern over code breakage.</p>

The advantage of adding implicit constant initialization here would be that those temporary const argument scenarios would no longer dangle. Static storage duration for arguments is actually the primary goal of this paper. It should also be noted that while <code>static</code> can be applied explicitly in class data member definition and in function bodies, static isn't even an option as a modifier to a function argument, so the user doesn't have a choice and the current default of automatic storage duration instead of static storage duration is less intuitive when constants of constant expressions are involved. Even if the keyword <code>static</code> could be applied to arguments, programmer's code will be littered with that keyword as they will start applying it to every argument initialized in a constant expression fashion.</p>
<!--

### C++20

This should be able to force static storage duration for arguments.

https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/template_parameters

```cpp
template<auto constant_expression>
const auto constant()
{
    return &constant_expression;
}

some_function(constant<constant_expression>());
```

-->
<!--
### A common example

After applying this proposal and ensuring `std::string_view` and other reference types have a `constexpr` constructor that can take `const` parameters. Does the following example still dangle?

```cpp
std::string_view sv = "hello world"s;// immediate dangling reference
```
-->
<!--
Example

// x86-64 clang (trunk)
// -std=c++20 -O2 -Wdangling-gsl
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std::string_literals;

int main() {
    std::string_view sv = "hello world"s;
    std::cout << sv << std::endl;
    return 42;
}
-->
<!--
It is clear from this `string_view` example that it dangles because `sv` is a reference and `""s` is a temporary.
***What is being proposed is that same example doesn't dangle!***
If the constant expression `"hello world"s` was promoted to static storage duration then `sv` could be a reference to something that is global and as such would not dangle. This is reasonable based on how users reason about constants, safer because of less dangling and simpler because something as simple as constants shouldn't dangle.
-->
<!--

That given simple reasonable conditions, the lifetime of the temporary gets automatically extended.

## The conditions

1. the argument would, prior to this proposal, be a temporary
1. the type of the parameter is a constant reference or constant pointer
1. type of the temporary argument has a constexpr constructor
1. **[Optional]** type of the temporary argument has compile time comparison; constexpr <=>

What is being proposed is that the storage duration of the argument, under these specific conditions, be changed from automatic to static!
In other words, the temporary argument would be constructed with the constexpr constructor, stored statically in read only memory and automatically deduplicated if this unnamed constant expression was used more than once provided the type has an optional `constexpr` spaceship operator.

This is reasonable because a constant reference/pointer parameter doesn't care how the object was constructed. Further, if the compiler has the choice to constexpr construct the object once rather than repeatedly throughout the execution of the program, than why wouldn't a developer want that.

This feature is also similar to existing features/concepts that programmers are familiar with. This feature is an implicit anonymous `constant`. It is more like an implicit anonymous `static local`. Really, at the end of the day, it is just another literal. For new `C++` programmers, old programmers from other programming languages and even old `C++` programmers it can be surprising when something as simple and trivial as a literal fails. No less, why one has to be overly attentive to it in the first place.

There is interest in eliminating, if not reducing dangling references. Consider:

1. `Why lifetime of temporary doesn't extend till lifetime of enclosing object?` [^soauto]
1. `Bind Returned/Initialized Objects to the Lifetime of Parameters` [^bindp]
1. `Lifetime safety: Preventing common dangling` [^lifetimesafety]

These talks about identify such issues but this proposal would address a small portion of them especially ones that would be considered surprising to programmers.

<p>Only recently have we had all the pieces to make this happen. Further there is greater need now that more types are getting constexpr constructors.

<p>The proposed valid example is reasonable from many programmers perspective because <code>"hello"s</code> is a literal just like <code>"hello"</code> is a safe literal in C++ and C99 compound literals are <strong>safer</strong> literals because the lifetime is the life of the block instead of the expression.

## Rationale


### Expectations

There is a general expectation that constant expressions are already of static storage duration. While that is partially wrong, that expectation is still there. Consider the following examples. Everywhere you see ROMable, you might as well say constant and global/static.

**December 19, 2012**

`Using constexpr to Improve Security, Performance and Encapsulation in C++` [^smartbear]

*"One of the advantages of **user-defined literals** with a small memory footprint is that an implementation can store them in the system’s **ROM**. Without a **constexpr constructor**, the object would require dynamic initialization and therefore wouldn’t be **ROM-able**."*

...

*"**Compile-time evaluation of expressions** often leads to more efficient code and enables the compiler to store the result in the system’s **ROM**."*

**May 21, 2015**

`Bitesize Modern C++ : constexpr` [^bitesize]

*"**ROM-able** types"*

...

*"<u>Since everything required to construct the **Rommable** object is known at **compile-time** it can be constructed in **read-only memory**.</u>"*

**4 February 2019**

`C++ Core Guidelines: Programming at Compile Time with constexpr` [^guidelines]

*"A constant expression"*

-  *"**can** be evaluated at **compile time**."*
-  *"give the compiler deep insight into the code."*
-  *"are implicitly thread-safe."*
-  *"**can** be constructed in the **read-only memory (ROM-able)**."*

It isn't just that resolved constant expressions **can** be placed in ROM which makes programmers believe these **should** be stored globally but also the fact that fundamentally **these expressions are executed at compile time**. Along with templates, constant expressions are the closest thing `C++` has to **pure** functions. That means the results are the same given the parameters, and since these expressions run at compile time, than the resultant values are the same, no matter where or when in the `C++` program. This is essentially global to the program; technically across programs too.

This proposal just requests that at least in specific scenarios that instead of resolved constant expressions **CAN** be ROMable but rather that they **HAVE** to be or at least the next closest thing; constant and `static storage duration`.

Let's also consider the view of compiler writers briefly.

**Asked 9 years, 10++ months ago**

`How can I get GCC to place a C++ constexpr in ROM?` [^gccconstexprrom]

...

*"As far as I understand the ffx object in the code below should end up in **ROM (code)**, but instead it is placed in **DATA**."*

...

*"This is indeed fixed in gcc 4.7.0"*

So there is at least some understanding among compiler writers that instances produced from constexpr expressions
were ROMable. What is more interesting is that it doesn't matter if it is in the ROM/code/text segment or the DATA segment, it is still global regardless of which. One is just read only. If we can guarantee `static storage duration` for constant temporaries we can reduce danglings.

<p>A brief consideration of the proposals that led to <code>constexpr</code> landing as a feature in <code>C++11</code> bears weight on the justification of refining constant initialization.</p>
<h4 id="n1511"><a class="anchor" href="#n1511"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>n1511</h4>
<p><strong><em><code>Literals for user-defined types</code></em></strong> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>2003</strong></p>
<p><em>"This note proposes a notion of <strong>user-defined literals</strong> based on literal constructors without requiring new syntax. If combined with the separate proposal for generalized initializer lists, it becomes a generalization of the <strong>C99 notion of compound literals</strong>."</em></p>
<p><em>"However, a constructor is a very general construct and there have been many requests for a way to express literals for user-defined types in such a way that a programmer can be <strong>confident that a value <u>will be</u> constructed at compile time</strong> and <strong>potentially stored in ROM</strong>. For example:"</em></p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">complex</span> <span class="hljs-title">z</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">2</span>)</span></span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// the variable z can be constructed at compile time</span>

The problem with that is that some people will not trust compilers to do proper resolution, placement in ROM, placement in text segment</strong>, etc. Choosing that solution would require text in the standard to constrain and/or guide implementations."</em></p>
<p><em>"<strong>C99 compound literals</strong>"</em></p>
<p><em>"In C99, it is explicitly allowed to take the address of a compound literal. For example:"</em></p>
<pre><code class="hljs">f(&amp;(<span class="hljs-keyword">struct</span> foo) { <span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">2</span> });</code></pre><p><em>"<strong>This makes sense only if we assume that the {1,2} is stored in a data segment (like a string literal</strong>, but different from a int literal). <strong>I see no problem allowing that, as long as it is understood that unless &amp; is explicitly used or the literal, a user-defined literal is an rvalue</strong> with which the optimizer has a free hand."</em></p>
<p><em>"<strong>It would be tempting to expand this rule to user-defined literals bound to references.</strong> For example:"</em></p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">f</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-keyword">complex</span>&amp;)</span></span>;
 <span class="hljs-comment">// …</span>
 f(<span class="hljs-keyword">complex</span>(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">2</span>)); <span class="hljs-comment">// ok?</span></code></pre><p><em>"However, this would touch upon some rather brittle parts of the overload resolution rules to do with rvalue vs. lvalue. For example:"</em></p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in">vector</span>&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span>&gt; v;
 <span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span>
 <span class="hljs-built_in">vector</span>&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span>&gt;().swap(v); <span class="hljs-comment">// ok</span>
 swap(<span class="hljs-built_in">vector</span>&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span>&gt;(), v); <span class="hljs-comment">// would become ok</span></code></pre><p><em>"I suggest we don’t touch this <strong>unless we are looking at the rvalue/lvalue rules for other reasons.</strong>"</em></p>
<p>The other reason why we should re-evaluate user-defined literals bound to references is to reduce dangling references and even dangling pointers. It is also surprising that user defined literals do not work simply without memory issues and that they currently work better in C and practically in every other language than it does in C++. ROM, read only memory, is effectively global/static storage duration and const. Note too that the original motivation for constant expressions are for literals. So constant expressions are effectively literals. Note also the following example provided in that proposal.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">complex</span> <span class="hljs-title">z</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">2</span>)</span></span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// the variable z can be constructed at compile time</span>
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">complex</span> <span class="hljs-title">cz</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">2</span>)</span></span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// the const cz can potentially be put in ROM</span></code></pre><p>While both constant expressions are the same, the detail that decides whether it is a literal that can even be placed in ROM was the <code>const</code> keyword. So, <code>const</code> constant expressions are constant literals or simply, constants.</p>
<!--
It wouldn't hurt to fix any brittle rules and in the 10++ years since we got `constexpr` some of these may have already been fixed and it could be time to review these finer points.

Even if these brittle concerns haven't already been addressed, two things could be performed to mitigate these concerns. For instance a automatic conversion from lvalue reference to pointer would allow passing implicit and explicit, via `&`, references to pointer arguments. Along with static duration, `C++` would then support the address of `C99` compound literal syntax.

A more complicated solution for references would require compilers not just to look at 2 types but instead 3: the type of the resolved `constexpr`, the type of the argument and the explicit '&' in front of the `constexpr` when the argument is a pointer.

<h3 id="present"><a class="anchor" href="#present"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Present</h3>
<p>This proposal should also be considered in the light of the current standards. A better idea of our current rules is necessary to understanding how they may be simplied for the betterment of <code>C++</code>.</p>
<h4 id="c-standard-compound-literals"><a class="anchor" href="#c-standard-compound-literals"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>C Standard Compound Literals</h4>
<p>Let's first look at how literals specifically compound literals behave in <code>C</code>. There is still a gap between <code>C99</code> and <code>C++</code> and closing or reducing that gap would not only increase our compatibility but also reduce dangling.</p>
<p><code>2021/10/18 Meneide, C Working Draft</code> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p><em>"6.5.2.5 Compound literals"</em></p>
<p><strong>paragraph 5</strong></p>
<p><em>"The value of the compound literal is that of an unnamed object initialized by the initializer list. If the compound literal occurs outside the body of a function, the object has static storage duration; otherwise, it has <strong>automatic storage duration associated with the enclosing block</strong>."</em></p>
<p>The lifetime of this "enclosing block" is longer than that of <code>C++</code>. In <code>C++</code> under <code>6.7.7 Temporary objects [class.temporary]</code> specifically <code>6.12</code> states a <em>temporary bound to a reference in a new-initializer (7.6.2.8) persists until the completion of the full-expression containing the new-initializer</em>.</p>
<p><code>GCC</code> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">[18]</a></sup> describes the result of this gap.</p>
<p><em>"<strong>In C, a compound literal designates an unnamed object with static or automatic storage duration. In C++, a compound literal designates a temporary object that only lives until the end of its full-expression. As a result, well-defined C code that takes the address of a subobject of a compound literal can be undefined in C++</strong>, so G++ rejects the conversion of a temporary array to a pointer."</em></p>
<p>Simply put <code>C</code> has fewer dangling than <code>C++</code>. What is more is that <code>C</code>'s  solution covers both const and non const temporaries! Even though it is <code>C</code>, it is more like <code>C++</code> than what people give this feature credit for because it is tied to blocks/braces, just like RAII. This adds more weight that the <code>C</code> way is more intuitive. Consequently, the remaining dangling should be easier to spot for developers not having to look at superfluous dangling.</p>
<p>GCC even takes this a step forward which is closer to what this proposal is advocating. The last reference also says the following.</p>
<p><em>"<strong>As a GNU extension, GCC allows initialization of objects with static storage duration by compound literals (which is not possible in ISO C99 because the initializer is not a constant).</strong> It is handled as if the object were initialized only with the brace-enclosed list if the types of the compound literal and the object match. <strong>The elements of the compound literal must be constant.</strong> If the object being initialized has array type of unknown size, the size is determined by the size of the compound literal."</em></p>
<p>The <code>C++</code> standard recognized that their are other opportunities for constant initialization.</p>
<p><code>Working Draft, Standard for Programming Language C++</code> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1:7">[1:7]</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>"<em>6.9.3.2 Static initialization [basic.start.static]</em>"</strong></p>
<p>"<em>3 An implementation is permitted to perform the initialization of a variable with static or thread storage duration as a static initialization even if such initialization is not required to be done statically, provided that</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>(3.1) — the dynamic version of the initialization does not change the value of any other object of static or thread storage duration prior to its initialization, and</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>(3.2) — the static version of the initialization produces the same value in the initialized variable as would be produced by the dynamic initialization if all variables not required to be initialized statically were initialized dynamically.</em>"</p>
<p>This proposal is one such opportunity. Besides improving constant initialization, we'll be increasing memory safety by reducing dangling.</p>
<p><strong>Should <code>C++</code> just adopt <code>C99</code> literal lifetimes being scoped to the enclosing block instead of to the <code>C++</code> statement, in lieu of this proposal?</strong></p>
<p>NO, there is still the expectation among programmers that constants, const evaluations of constant expressions, are of by default of static storage duration.</p>
<p><strong>Should <code>C++</code> adopt <code>C99</code> literal lifetimes being scoped to the enclosing block instead of to the <code>C++</code> statement, in addition to this proposal?</strong></p>
<p>YES, <code>C99</code> literal lifetimes does not guarantee any reduction in dangling, it just reduces it. This proposal does guarantee but only for const evaluations of constant expressions. Combined their would be an even greater reduction in dangling. As such this proposal and <code>C99</code> compound literals are complimentary. The remainder can be mitigated by other measures.</p>
<p><strong>Should <code>C++</code> adopt <code>C99</code> literal lifetimes being scoped to the enclosing block instead of to the <code>C++</code> statement?</strong></p>
<p>YES, the <code>C++</code> standard is currently telling programmers that the first two examples in the following table are equivalent with respect to the lifetime of the temporary <code>{1, 2}</code> and the named variable <code>cz</code>. This is because the lifetime of the temporary <code>{1, 2}</code> is bound to the statement, which means it is destroyed before <code>some_code_after</code> is called.</p>

<p>This is contrary to general programmer expectations and how it behaves in <code>C99</code>. Besides the fact that a large portion of the <code>C++</code> community has their start in <code>C</code> and besides the fact that no one, in their right mind, would ever write/expand the second example, for every function call that have arguments, their is a more fundamental reason why it is contrary to general programmer expectations.

<p>It should be noted that neither of the "<code>What is C++ doing?</code>" examples even compile. The first because the variable <code>ndc</code> is not accessible to the functional call <code>some_code_after</code>. The second because the class <code>no_default_constructor</code> doesn't have a default constructor and as such does not have a uninitialized state. In short, the current <code>C++</code> behavior of statement scoping of temporaries instead of containing block scoping is more difficult to reason about because the equivalent code cannot be written by the programmer. As such the <code>C99</code> way is simpler, safer and more reasonable.</p>
<p>Regardless, dangling would still be possible, especially for non constant expressions. Those could be fixed by some future, non constant expression proposals.</p>
<p>For instance, stackoverflow has a good example of dangling with <code>Compund literals storage duration in C</code> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">[19]</a></sup>.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-comment">/* Example 2 - if statements with braces */</span>

}
value = evaluate_polynomial(coefficients);</code></pre><p>If <code>coefficients</code> was const, as it should be since all control paths lead to constant expressions, than even this example would not dangle with this proposal. While this example is an example of dangling, it is also an example of uninitialized or more specifically delayed initialization. Interestingly, perhaps in the future, the binding block in question could be the block where <code>coefficients</code> is defined, that is the block containing the unitialized variable that is assigned to a constant expression, instead of the block where the uninitialized <code>coefficients</code> is initiated. This refinement to the <code>C</code> and <code>C++</code> rules would fix even more non constexpr dangling in a simple reasonable way.</p>
<p>Once these trivial dangling is removed from the language, the remaining non const dangling could be handled by <code>Bind Returned/Initialized Objects to the Lifetime of Parameters</code> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2:4">[2:4]</a></sup> or by some similar proposal preferably by fixing it if it makes sense or by a hard error if it really is a decision that the programmer must make.</p>
<h4 id="c-standard"><a class="anchor" href="#c-standard"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>C++ Standard</h4>
<p>It is also good to consider how the <code>C++</code> standard impacts this proposal and how the standard may be impacted by such a proposal.</p>
<p><code>Working Draft, Standard for Programming Language C++</code> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1:8">[1:8]</a></sup></p>
<p>String literals are traditionally one of the most common literals and in <code>C++</code> they have static storage duration. This is also the case in many programming languages. As such, these facts leads developers to incorrectly believe that all literals or at least all constant literals have static storage duration.</p>
<p><em>"5.13.5 String literals [lex.string]"</em></p>
<p><em>"9 Evaluating a string-literal results in a string literal object with <strong>static storage duration</strong> (6.7.5). Whether all string-literals are distinct (that is, are stored in nonoverlapping objects) and whether successive evaluations of a string-literal yield the same or a diﬀerent object is unspecifed."</em></p>
<p><em>"[Note 4: <strong>The eﬀect of attempting to modify a string literal object is undefined.</strong> — end note]"</em></p>
<p>This proposal aligns or adjusts literals not only with <code>C</code> compound literals but also with <code>C++</code> string literals. It too should be noted that <code>C++</code> is seemingly anbiguous on whether other literals are like string. Are array literals of <code>static storage duration</code>? What about if the array was of characters?</p>
<!--
If currently unspecifed, this proposal favors making both native and custom literals that are constant expressions into `static storage duration`.

<p><code>C++</code> also says the <em>"eﬀect of attempting to modify a string literal object is undefined."</em> With us having <code>const</code> for so long, there is few reasons for this to go undefined. Undefined behavior doesn't make constants and non constant literals any easier to deal with. A string literal could have <strong>static storage duration</strong> for constant expressions and <strong>automatic storage duration</strong> for <strong>non</strong> constant expressions, just like other literals. The lifetime of the <code>automatic storage duration</code> could be the <code>C</code> rule of the enclosing block since it is safer than <code>C++</code>. This would further increase the consistency between string literals and custom/constexpr literals. However, considering that string literals currently have <code>static storage duration</code> and we want to reduce dangling instead of increasing it by making the lifetime too narrow, it would be reasonable to include rules for uninitialized and general lifetime extension via <code>Bind Returned/Initialized Objects to the Lifetime of Parameters</code> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2:5">[2:5]</a></sup> before nudging string literals closer to non string literals.</p>

<p>"<em>The reason for the undefined behavior above is that according to the current specification, the range-base
for loop internally is <strong>expanded to multiple statements</strong>:</em>"</p>

<li>"<em>Then, we are calling a low-level for loop</em>"</li>
</ul>
<p>While certainly a factor, the problem is <strong>NOT</strong> that internally, the range-base for loop is expanded to multiple statements. It is rather that one of those statements has a scope of the statement instead of the scope of the containing block. The scoping difference between <code>C99</code> and <code>C++</code> rears it head again. From the programmers perspective, the issue in both cases is that <code>C++</code> doesn't treat temporaries, unnamed variable as if they were named by the programmer just anonymously. The supposed <code>correct usage</code> highlights this fact.</p>

### Future

There are many paths to reducing dangling via using `static storage duration`. The question that need answering is too what degree do we do it and whether or not we also reduce the gap between `C` and `C++`.

#### Proposal #1: `C++` with `static storage duration`

##### Wording

6.7.7 Temporary objects [class.temporary]

(6.12) — A temporary bound to a reference in a new-initializer (7.6.2.8) persists until the completion of the full-expression containing the new-initializer ++unless the expected type is constant and the temporary possesses a constexpr constructor in which case the temporary is no longer a temporary but rather is of static storage duration++.

NOTE: All examples of dangling need to be revised for not involving constant expressions.

#### Proposal #2: `C compound literals` with `static storage duration`

##### Wording

6.7.7 Temporary objects [class.temporary]

(6.12) — A temporary bound to a reference in a new-initializer (7.6.2.8) persists until the completion of the ++enclosing block of the++ full-expression containing the new-initializer ++unless the expected type is constant and the temporary possesses a constexpr constructor in which case the temporary is no longer a temporary but rather is of static storage duration++.

NOTE: All examples of dangling need to be revised for not involving constant expressions.

#### Optional Addendum #1 - Deduplication

##### Wording

5.13.5 String literals [lex.string]

9 Evaluating a string-literal results in a string literal object with static storage duration (6.7.5). Whether ~~all~~ string-literals ++bound to a character pointer++ are distinct (that is, are stored in nonoverlapping objects) and whether successive evaluations of a string-literal yield the same or a diﬀerent object is unspecifed. ++All successive evaluations of a string-literals bound to a const pointer should yield the same object. Similarly too, all successive evaluations of a custom string-like-literals bound to a const pointer should yield the same object. Further, std::basic_string_view should be stored in overlapping objects.++

[Note 4: The eﬀect of attempting to modify a string literal object is undefned. — end note]

#### Optional Addendum #2 - Undefined Strings

##### Wording

5.13.5 String literals [lex.string]

9 ++Evaluating a string-literal bound to a character pointer results in a string literal object with automatic storage duration (6.7.5).++ Evaluating a string-literal ++bound to a const character pointer++ results in a string literal object with static storage duration (6.7.5). Whether all string-literals are distinct (that is, are stored in nonoverlapping objects) and whether successive evaluations of a string-literal yield the same or a diﬀerent object is unspecifed.

~~[Note 4: The eﬀect of attempting to modify a string literal object is undefined. — end note]~~

#### Optional Addendum #3 - Arrays

Similar wording as for string-literals is needed for native arrays, const std::array, const std::span and initializer lists.

#### Optional Addendum #4 - Address of literal

In order to allow taking the address of a literal, either a new conversion needs adding or the lvalue reference composition rules need revising.

```cpp
f(&(struct foo) { 1,2 });
```

++7.3.16 Lvalue-to-pointer conversion [conv.lval.pointer]++

++1 An lvalue of type T can be converted to a type “pointer to T”.++

++or++

++Taking the explicit address, `&`, of a lvalue reference yields the lvalue reference unless a pointer of compatible type is expected.++

#### Optional Addendum #5 - Delayed Initialization

Assigning a literal to a non const uninitialiated variable results in the lifetime of the literal being the block that contains the declaration of said variable. This one is for that earlier example found on stack overflow.

```cpp
/* Example 2 - if statements with braces */

double *coefficients, value;

if(x){
    coefficients = (double[3]) {1.5, -3.0, 6.0};
}else{
    coefficients = (double[3]) {4.5, 1.0, -3.5};
}
value = evaluate_polynomial(coefficients);
```

### Why not just make the evaluation of all constant expressions by default of `static storage duration`?

This too would reduce dangling in the same way as this proposal and has the added benefit of being even simpler rules. [To be decided]
-->
<h3 id="what-about-locality-of-reference"><a class="anchor" href="#what-about-locality-of-reference"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What about locality of reference?</h3>
<p>It is true that globals can be slower than locals because they are farther in memory from the code that uses them. So let me clarify, when I say <code>static storage duration</code>, I really mean <strong>logically</strong> <code>static storage duration</code>. If a type has a <code>constexpr</code> copy constructor or is a <code>POD</code> than there is nothing preventing the compiler from copying the global to a local that is closer to the executing code. Rather, the compiler <strong>must</strong> ensure that the code is always available; <strong>effectively</strong> <code>static storage duration</code>.</p>
<p>Consider this from an processor and assembly/machine language standpoint. A processor usually has instructions that works with memory. Whether that memory is ROM or is logically so because it is never written to by a program, then we have constants.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">mov &lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">register</span>&gt;,&lt;memory&gt;</code></pre><p>A processor may also have specialized versions of common instructions where a constant value is taken as part of the instruction itself. This too is a constant. However, this constant is guaranteed closer to the code because it is physically a part of it.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">mov &lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">register</span>&gt;,&lt;constant&gt;
mov &lt;memory&gt;,&lt;constant&gt;</code></pre><p>What is more interesting is these two examples of constants have different value categories since the ROM version is addressable and the instruction only version, clearly, is not. It should also be noted that the later unamed/unaddressable version physically can't dangle.</p>
